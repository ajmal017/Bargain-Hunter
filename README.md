# Bargain-Hunter
A simple algorithm to look through companies and pick out stocks that meet the criteria. The criteria was inspired by Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor (https://www.e-reading-lib.com/bookreader.php/133361/The_Intelligent_Investor.pdf page 362 and page 399).

The criteria includes: \n
-Earnings increase of 10% over 4 years
-Current price no more than 1.5x book value per share
-P/E ratio <= 15
-Long term debt less than 110% current assets
-Current assets at least 1.5x current liabilities
